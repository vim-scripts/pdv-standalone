This is a standalone version of Tobias Schlitt's famous phpDocumentor for Vim plugin.

I was pretty happy with Tobias' original plugin (thanks Tobias!) but i had two issues with it:

 * You had to alter the code to configure the plugin
* Tobias integrated the latest version into his new VIP (VIM integration for PHP) repository but i didn't need/want the rest in there

(If you prefer Tobias' original repo, you find it at https://github.com/tobyS/vip.)

Find full installation instructions and configuration options on the development site at github:
